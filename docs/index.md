# LazyOps Documentation

Welcome to the LazyOps documentation hub. This site captures the refreshed
guides, coding standards, and planning notes that accompany the `lzl` utility
namespace and the `lzo` registry toolkit.

- **Quick Start:** Review [Mintlify workflow](mintlify) for local preview
  commands.
- **Coding Standards:** Follow the conventions in
  [Code Style](code-style) when writing or reviewing modules under `src/`.
- **Roadmap:** Track upcoming refactors and documentation follow-ups in
  [Future Updates](future-updates) and [Todo](todo).

Additional pages will be added as the refactor progresses toward the upcoming
`v0.3.x` release.
