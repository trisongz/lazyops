# Changelog Policy

**Rule:** All code changes (bug fixes, features, refactoring, documentation updates) MUST be documented in a new changelog file.

**File Location & Naming:**
Create a new markdown file in the `docs/changelogs/` directory using the following format:
`{mm-dd-yyyy}-{snake_case_summary_of_changes}.md`

*   Example: `docs/changelogs/08-15-2024-update_property_docstrings.md`

**Content Requirements:**
Each changelog file MUST include:

1.  **Summary:** A brief description of the changes made.
2.  **Justification:** The reasoning behind the change (e.g., fixing a bug, improving performance, adhering to standards, implementing a feature).
3.  **Usage Examples (If Applicable):** If the change affects how code is used or introduces new functionality, provide clear code examples.
4.  **Dependency Changes:** Explicitly state if any project dependencies were added, removed, or updated.
5.  **Breaking Changes:** Clearly mark any changes that are **not** backward compatible using a heading like `### Breaking Changes` and explain the impact.
